This is a wholesale copy of the https://github.com/redhat-cop/container-pipelines project for basic-spring-boot.

I have modified it to instead deploy the openshift-tasks project located here: https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-tasks

I've moved the original README.md to README.md.orig.

All credit goes to those guys - I just changed values in the script  in the hopes of getting this to work.
