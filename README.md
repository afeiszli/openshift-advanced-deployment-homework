#### Helper Scripts: scripts/


This repository and all of the artifacts inside of it are the result of the classes I just attended. The entire repository does not represent anything officially produced by Red Hat in any way shape or form.  Almost all of this content is based upon other people's work, the documentation, or notes taken during the class.  All mistakes, errors and ommisions are my own.  I strongly urge you not to use the contents of this repository for anything you care about in the slightest.  There are bound to be mistakes of one kind or another, and your entire cluster may burst into **flames** if you use the inventory, templates, or any playbooks contained in this repository.  You have been warned.
